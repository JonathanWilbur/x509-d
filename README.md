# X.509 D Library

Abandoned, not for lack of quality, but because I believe Rust is probably a
better programming language, and I am going to re-implement this in Rust.

## Building and Installing

There are four scripts in `build/scripts` that help you build this library,
in addition to building using `dub`. If you are using Windows, you can build
by running `.\build\scripts\build.ps1` from PowerShell, or `.\build\scripts\build.bat`
from the traditional `cmd` shell. If you are on any POSIX-compliant(-ish)
operating system, such as Linux or Mac OS X, you may build this library using
`./build/scripts/build.sh` or `make -f ./build/scripts/posix.make`. The output
library will be in `./build/libraries`. The command-line tools will be in
`./build/executables`.

For more information on building and installing, see `documentation/install.md`.
